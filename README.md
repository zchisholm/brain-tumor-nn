# brain-tumor-nn
This project focuses on training neural networks to classify tumors in brain MRI scans. It covers the construction of various neural network architectures using transfer learning and custom convolutional layers. Additionally, the project utilizes the Gemini 1.5 Flash model to generate explanations for the model's predictions.
